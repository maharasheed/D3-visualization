The aim from this visualization is ti visualize time-series data related to stocks is a simplified way by showing all the data along with clusteres for data with similarities to reduce the amount of data to users. The code is written in D3, and two libraries have been used: d3.min.v3 and d3.min.v4.
The code reads the data from a csv file called data.csv. This file includee stock values along with special entries that their IDs start with C, which are the result of clustering. The x-axis as the graph shows represents time, and the y-axis illustrates the values. The max and min values for both axises are the min/max value read from data. The x-axis can be controlled by either adjusting it through the mouse or by the zooming function implemented in the code. Through this slider, we can specify a range of time and scroll it from left to right. Every value in the csv file has been mapped and stored in a list, and every unique value is represented in a list next to the graph, we can select the lines the should appear in the graph by selecting it from that list. For simplicity the user can select the clusters and observe their values, then the user can discover the data in each cluster. By that, the data visualized will be reduced. The line graphs are also visualized inside the slider, so we can see the whole data while zooming into smaller range of time. The code is dynamic, it can read any amount of data and visualize it. Every function implemented in the code has comments that explains it. NOTE: the data should be in the format specified in the code, any change made to the data should also be changed in the code.
